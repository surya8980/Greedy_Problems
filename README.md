# Greedy_Problems
This repository contains solutions to problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms, a problem-solving paradigm where locally optimal choices are made at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. These solutions demonstrate how and why a greedy approach works for certain problem types and offer insights into common greedy strategies.
